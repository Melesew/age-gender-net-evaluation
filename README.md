## Resources
dataset = [IMDB-WIKI â€“ 500k+ face images with age and gender labels](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/)

## How it works
main.py train the network and saves the model, gen.h5

extract_imdb_mat.py takes the dataset from imdb_crop directory and extract labeled data.

facecrop.py takes the labeled datas and crop faces and put them in cropped directory

predict.py takes cropped images, predict thier gedner and move them on their respective directory

visually_inspect.py visualizes the models performance

## Usage
**to test with certain pics** = python3 predict.py --model "models/gen.h5" --image "path to image "

**to test with web-cam** = python demo_from_cam.py

## Results
